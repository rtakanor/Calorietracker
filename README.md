# 🏋️ Fitness Calorie & Workout Planner (C++)

This is a simple and interactive C++ console application that helps users estimate their daily calorie needs and view customized weekly workout plans based on their fitness goals.

## 📌 Features

- 🔢 Calculates **BMR** (Basal Metabolic Rate) based on gender, age, weight, and height.
- 🔥 Calculates **TMR** (Total Metabolic Rate) using physical activity level.
- 🍽️ Suggests calorie goals for:
  - Bulking (muscle gain)
  - Cutting (fat loss)
- 🗓️ Displays **weekly workout routines** based on the selected goal.
- 👤 Uses an OOP-based `UserProfile` class.
- 🧠 Uses a custom `Fitness` namespace to organize logic clearly.

## 🛠️ How It Works

After entering your basic details (age, weight, height, gender), you can:

1. Get calories needed for **bulking** and view a strength-focused routine.
2. Get calories needed for **cutting** and view a cardio-focused routine.
3. Just see your **BMR** (daily resting calorie burn).
